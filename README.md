# Sustainable CVRP Optimization with Large-Scale Road Network Data in C++

I conducted this project during my master's degree, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. J√∂rn Sch√∂nberger, Chair of Transport Services and Logistics at TU Dresden, Germany.
This project tackles the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)** with a focus on ** minimizing fuel emissions** using **meta-heuristic algorithms in C++**. It handles real-world large-scale road networks (~2.5GB). Solving CVRP with large real-world data is computationally intensive. Exact methods are infeasible due to the **combinatorial search space**. Therefore, the **local search metaheuristics approach** was used in this case.

## üèôÔ∏è Project Context

The project works on solving the problem: a **logistics provider** must deliver goods to **~100 supermarket locations** within the **urban area of Stuttgart, Germany**. The fleet consists of **different vehicle types** (e.g., small, medium, large trucks), each with **distinct fuel consumption characteristics**.

The optimization objective is to:
- **Minimize total fuel consumption**
- **Avoid overloading vehicles** (penalties applied when overloaded)
- The outcomes include the list of delivery requests **assigned** to different trucks, and the **sequences** of those requests.

# üß± Project Components

The project is structured in **four parts**:

### 1. üì¶ Scenario Development
- I used **XML-based scenario files**, which describe the input data including delivery network (nodes, arcs, depot, fleet types, delivery request (quantities,...)). This constructed a basic component of the problem. In this project, I tried the same delivery network with 5 different fleets (each different fleet has different types of trucks, thus different in the fuel consumption profiles)

### 2. üßÆ Optimization Model
- The mathematical model for this project is based on the model developed by Kopfer, H.W., Sch√∂nberger, J., & Kopfer, H. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions of a heterogeneous vehicle fleet. Flex Serv Manuf J 26, 221‚Äì248 (2014),  [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10696-013-9180-9](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10696-013-9180-9). Besides, the fuel consumption for different truck types was also referenced from thia paper.
  
- The model code is based on the VRP++ application Version 4.02 by the Chair of Transport Services and Logistics, TU Dresden. You can downnload the application at this [link](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/verkehr/ivw/vbl/software/vrp)
  
- From the VRP++ application, I built:
  - Add C++ objects to customize for the case of a heterogeneous fleet

  - Model penalty costs for overloads (including penalty on the number of overloaded vehicles and pallets.
    ![my C++ code of calculating the penalties](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81e484d9-b004-42ab-a3b1-6520d26a6c97)

  - Modify the objective function for **fuel-based optimization**
    
- The **Vehicle Routing Logic**: Sequential decision making: Assign requests to vehicles, Sequence deliveries per vehicle.
- Local search heuristics with **steepest descent** improve on an initial feasible solution.

### 3. üåç Real-Life Road-network Data Integration
- I downloaded data from [OpenStreetMap - Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/baden-wuerttemberg.html).
- This data was stored in a local database using **PostgreSQL** and some extensions ( `hstore`: key-value road metadata,  `postgis`: geospatial data types, and `pgrouting`: shortest path calculation).

### 4. üìä Sensitivity Analysis
- To evaluate the model's performance under different parameter configurations and data input, a batch process runs 405 XML scenario files automatically.
- Helps evaluate robustness and behavior under different constraints
